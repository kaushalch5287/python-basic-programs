# Polycarp has n coins, the value of the i-th coin is ai. Polycarp wants
# to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two
# coins with the same value into the same pocket.
# For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array
# a=[1,2,4,3,3,2], he can distribute the coins into two pockets as
# follows: [1,2,3],[2,3,4].
# Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number
# of used pockets. Help him to do that
